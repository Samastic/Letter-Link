# Letter Link

# A word-chain forming game!

## Description

Letter link is a game where you form chains of words by switching a single letter each time.
At the start of each game, you are given two words, and have to find the accompanying word chain.

For example, if the starting wordset is (lured, roped), then the chain would look like this:

- lured
- cured
- curer
- corer
- cored
- coped
- roped



This game is based off the "word chains" concept as seen in CodeParad's [Exploring Word Chains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuqNrV8LsQ).
